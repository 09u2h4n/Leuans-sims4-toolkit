## 🔒 Security & Transparency

### Open Source Commitment

This toolkit is **100% open source** and free. The entire codebase is available for inspection, ensuring complete transparency with our community.

### Addressing Security Concerns

We understand that security is paramount when downloading and running software. That's why:

- ✅ **Full source code is publicly available** - Review every line of code
- ✅ **No hidden functionality** - Everything the app does is visible in the source
- ✅ **Community auditable** - Anyone can verify there's no malicious code
- ✅ **Build it yourself** - Compile from source for complete peace of mind
- ✅ **Not-for-profit** - This is a free community project with no monetization
- ❌ **No, the webhooks don't work** - Before releasing it to GitHub i took them down, this way i avoid any possible troll spamming the webhook)

### Community Trust

We've heard concerns from community discussions about data security. We take these concerns seriously, which is why we've made this repository completely public. 

**If you have any doubts:** Compile it yourself! This is the best way to ensure you're running exactly what you see in the source code.
